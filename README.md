# Fingerprint Liveness Detection
We first extract features from fingerprint images and then develop machine learning models such as neural networks and SVM for classification of real and fake fingerprints. 
The feature extraction methods that we used were WLD, LPQ or some neural networks. In order to have a larger training set, we also introduced new training data by 
augmenting available training images. We were able to achieve, with the best approach, test accuracy ranging from 98% to 99%.

# Data set
We use the fingerprint images data set from "Liveness Detection Competitions 2015"  [Available Here](http://livdet.org/registration.php).
